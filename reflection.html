  <h1>Reflection</h1>
  <h2>  CMT-119 </h2>
  <h3>The Computational Thinking (CT) module has been very interesting 
    and educational. As a conversion student whose background is Law, I’ve had
     to solve many legal problems in the past, and reflecting on what I’ve learnt 
     in this module makes me understand a different cognitive process on how
      to solve problems. I am very aware that my understanding of CT is very basic
       and rudimentary at the current time, but I can see its progression over time 
       and how this mindset is essential for success in our increasingly digitalized world.</h3>
  <h3>Even though I wasn’t aware of what this process is formally named,
     I’ve always been inherently practicing and refining my ability to
      break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. However,
       I now recognize the importance of this process, and recognize that it 
       is fundamental to apply it not only to coding tasks, but also to complex 
       theories in other courses, group tasks from other modules, etc. This systematic
        approach simplifies problem-solving processes, but also helps me to resolve
         bigger and complex concepts or data, allowing me to solve problems with 
         clarity and precision. </h3>

    <h3>In the same way, pattern recognition -another pilar of CT- 
      has given me the ability to develop general solutions to specific problems,
       by identifying similarities and recurring patterns across seemingly
        different problems. Identifying patterns in data, and even in everyday
         scenarios has become routinary to me. It enables me to create generalized 
         solutions that can be adapted to diverse problems. I feel a lot more comfortable
          facing coding, mathematics and social problems in my day to day.</h3>
     <h3>Furthermore, CT has taught me the importance of data representation 
      and analysis. This skill represents superlative importance in our society, 
      because it’s not just about creating and analyzing algorithms, it can also be 
      applied to other disciplines. It can be translated into processing data and deriving 
      meaningful insights from it, for example, I can see myself applying this tool into 
      learning new languages or business analytics. </h3> 

      <h3>I believe that understanding CT helps me to approach the 
        remainder of my program with logical thinking and confidence. 
        The analytical mindset, problem-solved abilities that I’ve been 
        taught here are invaluable assets that will shape my academic and professional 
        journey. I am now able to face the future subjects with a better
         understanding on formal language, and in general, a strong analytical mindset, 
         that allows me to be an active problem-solver, creative thinker and analyst – all very
          important to perform well in computer science.</h3>
    <h3>In conclusion, the CT module has equipped me with important knowledge 
      that will serve as pillar to the rest of my academic journey. It has improved 
      the way I approach problem-solving, logical thinking, and most importantly, my 
      learning abilities. </h3>
